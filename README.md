## Goals
The objective of this work is to carry out an exploratory analysis to identify the factors correlated to the reduction or increase in life expectancy and to identify a mathematical model that can be used to predict life expectancy.

## Content
Data: world health agency and the united nations, IBGE data, Our World in Data organization and geolocation API.

## Inspiration
The data-set aims to answer the following key questions:

  - Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? 
  - What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
  - Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
  - How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
  - Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
  - What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
  - Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
  - Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
  - What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
